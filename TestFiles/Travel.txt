Travelling is the kind of activity, which almost all the people love. For someone it is an opportunity to relax and abstract from everyday busy life. For others it is interesting to observe the way people of other cultures and mentality live. Some people consider it to be the best way to have fun and always try to visit as many clubs, pubs, restaurants and cafes as possible for their wallets and time limits.

Of course, there are people who are always unhappy with the way the life is, and they will say that travelling is far from pleasant and involves a lot of stress due to the necessity to pack their things, use public transport and so on. But fortunately, those people are rather few and the majority understands how travelling is exciting and interesting.

As for me, I have always enjoyed watching all-round views from some altitudes. I enjoy watching them in my hometown and as soon as I am in some new city, I start looking for such spots right away. When I am in such a place, I just hold my breath and observe the beauty. At such moments I think about how our life is excellent, what beauty it offers us and how important it is to value each moment of our lives.

From such places it is so exciting to observe city views and imagine how thousands of people live in there and experience so many different feelings. I understand that I am not alone, that I have so many chances and that I can reach all my goals. The views of nature are also exciting, as while watching them, I wonder how such beauty can be created and how it is important not to spoil it.

To sum up, travelling is great due to the fact that each and every person can find something interesting and exciting for him- or herself. The main thing here is to be open-minded and positive in your aspirations and worldâ€™s perception.
