Though air pollution is the most common type of pollution evident today, it is not the only one. Besides air pollution, there are a number of human induced activities those pollute or natural resources like water bodies and soil. Inadvertent industrialization has led to air as well as water pollution, having adverse affects on environmental health. Industries require a good amount of water to operate and so are mainly set up in proximity to a naturally occurring stream, river or water body.

Also, the industrial waste which includes toxic chemicals like asbestos etc is carried away into our water bodies by using fresh water. It not only pollutes our natural water resources but also renders them harmful to use and results in decline of species, plants and algae.

Another most common factor threatening the health of water resources and soil is â€“ littering. Inadequate mechanism of waste disposal and ignorance results in littering at various places. The most common type of pollutant through littering is plastic. Thin plastic bags of varied dimensions, when not disposed properly; get into our water bodies and soil. Being non degradable they stay there for centuries, polluting them and threatening lives. Species like turtles and fishes are known to have eaten plastic and died capacity.
